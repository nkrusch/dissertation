\subsection*{Abstract}
Non-interference is an information flow policy for guaranteeing confidentiality, \ie that effects of sensitive data are not exposed to lower-level users, even indirectly. When phrased in terms of programming languages, non-interference is studied by attaching security classes to variables, then analyzing the classes to determine if a violation, or a data \enquote{leak}, can occur. Security type systems are common controls for analyzing and enforcing non-interference. Unfortunately, they require inference algorithms, program-level security specifications, non-standard compilers, and are generally too restrictive or complex for practical implementation. In this paper, we present a program logic \lname that guarantees the semantic security property of \emph{anytime non-interference}. By anytime, we mean a malicious actor with low-level access cannot infer anything about higher-level values at any point of the program execution. The logic links non-interference violations precisely to the faulty commands and violations cannot be erased by program composition. We draw rich inspiration from complexity-theoretic flow calculi, but obtaining a logic for security analysis required significant adjustments. Finally, we share a prototype to demonstrate \lname can be implemented as an automatic, annotation-free, static security analyzer to obtain confidentiality guarantees in practice.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Verifying that data is handled securely during computation is challenging because it requires information beyond the program syntax.
For example, consider a hash function that computes a checksum of its input.
Assume there exists a malicious actor who can observe outputs of the hash function.
If all inputs are public data, we can guarantee the function does not expose secrets to the actor.
However, if we change the inputs to secret data, like social security numbers, we no longer have the same guarantee for the same function.
The hash function then \enquote{leaks} information that possibly enables the actor to recover the secret data.

\emph{Non-interference}~\cite{goguen1982} is a classical semantic security property that constrains information flow during computation.
It is a mechanism to enforce \emph{confidentiality}, \ie concealment of information or resources from unauthorized parties~\cite{bishop2003}.
Non-interference is an attractive target of study because it offers strong end-to-end guarantees for data protection, it is inherently compositional%
%\clem{I have a problem with that. \prc|x = 0| is always ni, so if I compose it with a program that leaks data through \prc|x| then it's suddenly ok? We should be careful with that idea.}\neea{it is from [12]; see its abstract}
, and can be enforced with program logics or security type systems~\cite{cecchetti2017,frumin2021}.
Informally, a program is non-interfering when secret data does not affect calculation of its public outputs~\cite{sabelfeld2003}.
In other words, data can only stay at the same security class or flow to higher classes.
%\clem{Have somewhere motto "data can only stay at the same class or flow to higher classes.}
Although a desirable property, non-interference is in general undecidable by Rice's Theorem~\cite{rice1953} and constructing a system that completely adheres to non-interference is overly restrictive to capture real-world security requirements~\cite{bossi2005,cecchetti2017}.
However, unattainability of an ideal construction does not restrict analysis of imperfect systems.
Program analysis enables detecting information flow issues, supports informed assessments of vulnerabilities, and identifies potential mitigations.

Our work extends the analysis of non-interference %ways that connects \clem{with? to?} theoretical interest and
in theoretical directions while yielding practical advantages.
In literature, terminology around non-interference is defined somewhat fluidly~\cite{sabelfeld2003};
admitting multiple different but related {formal definitions}~\cite{nelson2020}, and generalizing to the informal description provided previously.
In this paper, we introduce the notion of \emph{anytime non-interference}.
The anytime property is powerful because it accounts for intermediate states of computation.
%\clem{and does not require nor suppose termination?}\neea{here it's the opposite of powerful}
Thus, it is strictly stronger than the classic non-interference that is expressed in terms of inputs and outputs.
To lift our theory toward the real world, we provide our main result:
a program logic \lname that enables lightweight automatic static program analysis of anytime non-interference.
We demonstrate practicality of \lname through examples, a prototype implementation,
and discussions of how anytime non-interference elegantly supports numerous program analysis applications.
%\eg partitioning computations based on data security classes.

% Anytime noninterference
Anytime non-interference tracks potential information flow leaks in every legal program state.
A non-interfering program can be interrupted arbitrarily without compromising its non-interference guarantee.
Conversely, once a violating operation has occurred, it is impossible to erase it.
%However, an important note must be made about time. \clem{Don't overdo it, everybody abstract time somewhat. It's just "our" notion of tick, it's fine really.}
We consider time as %abstract ticks corresponding to
updates of public variable values.
In other words, the latency between public variable updates is instant.
A change between two secret values, that causes a loop to iterate longer according to a physical clock, has no observable side effect.
In general, anytime non-interference models security at the abstraction level of programming languages and excludes lower-level execution details.
However, we consider the approach justified because potential information flow issues are often detectable from syntax.

% clarify termination + introduce the security-partitioning idea
Anytime non-interference is furthermore \emph{termination-insensitive}.
Because information signaled through termination can leak secrets indirectly, termination handling is an ongoing design challenge for non-interference systems~\cite{bay2020}.
Untrusted programs, that pose high security risks, require strong \emph{progress-sensitive} non-interference that considers both termination and I/O interactions~\cite{hedin2012}.
Trusted programs, with predictable run-time behavior, permit weaker security checks and termination-insensitivity.
Unfortunately, the binary situation provides no middle ground for programs that mix trusted and untrusted code, \eg by dynamic code loading.
In \autoref{termination} we discuss how to address this limitation by partitioning computations based on security classes.
This hybrid approach relaxes the limitations of termination-insensitivity and monolithic termination handing.

\subsubsection{The Essential Security Terminology Decoded}\label{subsec:terms}
% \clem{title a bit too scholar. Find something more intriguing?}}

Our work belongs to the domain of \emph{language-based security}~\cite{schneider2001,sabelfeld2003},
where programming languages principles (semantics, analysis, type systems, rewriting, \etc) are used to strengthen application security.
The \lname logic draws rich inspiration from implicit computational complexity (refer to~\autoref{sec:related-works}),
and has applications in static program analysis;
thus our work intersects many related fields.
Although we assume prior familiarity with logic and programming languages, we define the relevant security concepts in this section.

\emph{Information flow} denotes an observable action between two agents \(A\) and \(B\).
%\clem{We use that for variable, go with A and B, P and Q, ..? Or say that in our set-up, agents are variable?}.
If an action performed by \(A\) is observable to \(B\), then there exists an information flow from \(A\) to \(B\).
The flow is \emph{explicit} if it is directly observable from a single action.
The flow is \emph{implicit} when it is not directly observable, but reveals deductively the initial performed action, after a sequence of other actions.
To represent information flow, we manipulate the conventional lattice model Ã  la Denning~\cite{Denning76}.

An \emph{information flow policy} is a statement of what is, and what is not, permissible~\cite{bishop2003} for a program \prc|C| in terms of flow between its variables; formally defined as follows: %\clem{Maybe x and \prc|C| should be mentioned before, \emph{en passant}.}

\begin{definition}[Information Flow Policy~\protect{\cite{VolpanoI1996}}, Class Assignment]%
\label{def:ifp}
An \emph{information flow policy} is a lattice \(\SC = (\SCset, <)\) where \(\SCset\) is a partially \(<\)-ordered finite set of \emph{security classes}.

We write \(\ell\) for the class assignment that assigns statically and definitely to each variable \prc|x| occurring in a program \prc|C| its security class \(\lvl{\prc|x|} \in \SC\).
\end{definition}

By abuse of notation, we assume that a class assignment always comes with an information flow policy, we write \(c \in \SC\), and for any two classes \(c_1\), \(c_2\), we write \(c_1 \leqslant c_2\) if \(c_1 < c_2\) or \(c_1 = c_2\), and \(c_1 \orth c_2\) if  \(c_1 \nleqslant c_2\) and \(c_2 \nleqslant c_1\)--in this case, we say that \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are \emph{orthogonal}. % \clem{And write that they are orthogonal -- that terms needs to be introduced.}

A simple policy has two security classes, \eg \(\LH=(\{\scl{l}, \scl{h}\}, \{\scl{l} < \scl{h}\})\)---for \emph{low} and \emph{high}; but a policy can be arbitrarily complex (refer to \autoref{ex-hasse-diagram-HMO}, located in Appendix, for a more concrete example).
We generally use a Hasse diagram to represent the information flow policy and class assignment in a compact manner, as follows:

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.68\textwidth}
    \noindent
    \begin{alignat*}{7}
        & \SCset = \{b, m_1, m_2, t\} \span \span \\ % \span are here to "ignore" the & alignment
        & b < m_1 & \hspace{1.6em} & b < m_2 & \hspace{1.6em} & m_1 < t &\hspace{1.6em} & m_2 < t\\
        & \lvl{\prc|x|} = b && \lvl{\prc|y$_1$|} = m_1 && \lvl{\prc|y$_2$|}= m_2 && \lvl{\prc|w|} =  \lvl{\prc|z|}  = t
    \end{alignat*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.7em, node distance=1.2cm]
        \node (b) {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
        \node (m1) [above left of = b] {\(\lvl{\prc|y$_1$|}\)};
\node (m2) [above right of = b] {\(\lvl{\prc|y$_2$|}\)};
\node (t) [above right of = m1] {\(\lvl{\prc|w|} = \lvl{\prc|z|}\)};
\draw[->] (b) -- (m1);
\draw[->] (b) -- (m2);
\draw[->] (m1) -- (t);
\draw[->] (m2) -- (t);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}

An \emph{information flow control} (IFC) is a mechanism to enforce a policy~\cite{bishop2003}.
Security type systems (presented in \autoref{sec:related-works}) are an example of a programming languages based IFCs.
They enforce a policy by annotating a program with security types.
Then, to be secure, a program must pass a compile-time type check.
A sound IFC guarantees to find all policy violations and a precise IFC avoids raising excessive false alarms.

Formal security analysis uses the terms system model, security objective, and an attacker model~\cite{bau2011,bognar2022}.
Our \emph{system model}, \ie the system we want to secure, is a sequential imperative program, as specified in~\autoref{subsec:language}, with effectful function calls discussed in \autoref{sec:fct-calls}.
Our \emph{security objective}, \ie the system behaviors that are considered secure, is defined by anytime non-interference (\autoref{def:com-ni}).
An \emph{adversary} is a malicious actor who poses a threat to the system.
An \emph{attacker model} specifies the capabilities and motivations of the adversary.
We assume a \emph{program-centric}~\cite{hedin2012} attacker model, where the adversary can
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\roman*)]
\item see the program syntax
\item control public inputs and observe public outputs, and
\item up to the attacker's security class, access memory registers after updates.
\end{enumerate*}
%\clem{A bit more than that: can access all the memory register at their class or below after each update at their class or below.}

\subsubsection{Contributions} % as-strong-as-possible & refutable.
Our contributions are three-fold.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The main result is a lightweight syntactic IFC logic \lname (\autoref{ni-logic}),
with a built-in automatable inference algorithm, that captures the semantic property of anytime non-interference.

\item We introduce the definition of anytime non-interference (\autoref{def:com-ni}),
and prove its correspondence with \lname, that follows from the fundamental theorem (\autoref{thm:corr}).

\item We demonstrate the promising practical utility of \lname (\autoref{sec:apps}),
to include by describing our prototype static analyzer \tool for analysis of \texttt{Java} programs.
\end{enumerate}

\autoref{sec:fct-calls} furthermore discusses in detail how our approach can accommodate different treatments of functions with and without side effects, and \autoref{sec:examples} gathers additional examples to help understanding.

%\clem{maybe function thingy should make it there}

%The analysis compositionality, syntax extendability, built-in automatable inference algorithm, and handling of transitive dependencies and implicit flows are among the strengths of our technique.
%These features are of practical interest, since static language-based security analyses often ignore implicit flows~\cite[pg.~144]{huang2014}.
%Furthermore, as a syntactic logic, it captures precisely the statement and variables involved in a violation, allowing informative error-reporting to program developers.

\subsection{High-level Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

We consider deterministic imperative programs, with conventional operational semantics, and variables of basic data types (integers, strings, \etc).
Let our expository program be

\noindent\begin{center} % adds some vertical gap
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth} % prevents page break in the middle of the ex.
\begin{lstlisting}
if (z==1)
then if (x==1) then y = 1 else y = 0
else x = y
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\end{center}
In the program, certain data flows are potentially problematic.
The assignment \prc|x = y| is an instances of an explicit flow, since there is a direct flow from variable \prc|y| to \prc|x|.
The control expressions \prc|z==1| and \prc|x==1| represent implicit flows.
They reveal information over execution paths, and indirectly expose values of the control statement variables.
Admissibility of these data flows depends on the security classes of the variables, since non-interference forbids data flowing from higher classes to lower or between orthogonal classes.
A sound IFC detects such issues and raises an alarm.

The logic \lname produces a matrix of coefficients by applying inference rules to programs.
In a single derivation, it captures dependencies between all the program variables, for all execution paths and security classes.
The matrix is interpreted by matching the \emph{in-variables}, \(\prc|v|_{\text{in}}\) (rows), with the \emph{out-variables},
\(\prc|v|_{\text{out}}\) (columns).
The coefficients indicate:
\begin{description}
\item[\(\nv\)] -- \emph{no \emph{(non-interference)} violation}, no dependency from $\prc|v|_{\text{in}}$ to $\prc|v|_{\text{out}}$,
\item[\(\vi\)]  -- a \emph{violation}---or \enquote{leak}, hence the symbol---, if \(\lvl{\prc|v$_{\text{out}}$|} < \lvl{\prc|v$_{\text{in}}$|}\) or \(\lvl{\prc|v$_{\text{out}}$|} \orth \lvl{\prc|v$_{\text{in}}$|}\).
\end{description}

The matrix of the expository program,

\noindent\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0pt}
\raisebox{0pt}[\dimexpr\height-0.6\baselineskip\relax]{ %https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/160612
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|x|  & \prc|y|  & \prc|z| \\
\prc|x| & \nv      & \vi      & \nv \\
\prc|y| & \textcolor{lipicsGray!60}{\vi}      & \nv      & \nv \\
\prc|z| & \vi      & \vi      & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}$}
\end{wrapfigure}
expectedly shows \emph{potential} violations in from \prc|y| to \prc|x| (explicit, in gray here) and
\prc|x| to \prc|y|, \prc|z| to \prc|x|, and \prc|z| to \prc|y| (implicit).
The matrix gives a summary of potential violations for the program that induced it.
Evaluating the matrix determines if the program is non-interfering;
or if there exists a class assignment that makes the program non-interfering.
The evaluation function is parametric on the policy, enabling evaluation against different policies.
%These and other applications are discussed in \autoref{sec:analyzer}.

\subsection{The Non-interference Logic}%
\label{ni-logic}

\subsubsection{A Simple Imperative While Language}%
\label{subsec:language}

We use a simple imperative \prc|while| language, with semantics similar to \texttt{C}.
The grammar is given in \autoref{fig:grammar}.
The language supports arrays and we let \prc|for| and \prc|do...while| loops be represented using \prc|while| loops.
How function calls can be added is discussed in \autoref{sec:fct-calls}.
The language subsumes (up to \prc|letvar| construct) the \enquote{core block-structured language}~\cite{VolpanoI1996},
and it maps easily to the core fragment of \texttt{C}, Java, and other imperative programming languages.

\begin{figure}

\end{align*}%
\caption{A simple imperative \prc|while| language}%
\label{fig:grammar}
\end{figure}

A variable \prc|x|, \prc|y|, \prc|z|, \(\hdots\) represents either an undetermined \enquote{primitive} data type, \eg not a reference variable, or an array, whose indices are given by an expression.
We reserve $\prc|t|$ for arrays.
An expression is either a variable, a value (\eg integer literal) or the application to expressions of some operator \emph{op}, which can be \eg relational (\texttt{==},  \texttt{<}, \etc) or arithmetic  (\texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \etc).
We let \prc|e| (\resp \prc|C|) range over expressions (\resp commands).
We also use compound assignment operators and write \eg \prc|x++| for \prc|x+=1|.
We assume commands to be correct, \eg with operators correctly applied to expressions, no out-of-bounds errors, \etc. %, and often refer to them as \emph{programs}.
A \emph{program} \prc|C| is a sequence of commands, each command being either

an \emph{assignment},
a \emph{skip},
% a \emph{function call}\footnote{%
%	The \texttt{use} command represents any command which does not modify its variables, but uses them, and should not be moved around carelessly (\eg a \prc|printf|).
%	In practice, we currently treat all function calls as \texttt{use}, even if the function is pure.
%},%
a \emph{branching},
a while \emph{loop} or the \emph{composition of two commands}%\footnote{Note that functions can be called in isolation, or used in an assignment to store their return value into a variable.}
.
%\emph{Statements} are abstracted into \emph{commands}, which can be a statement or a sequence of commands.
A program $\prc|C|'$ is \emph{a sub-program of \prc|C|}, denoted \(\prc|C|' \subseteq \prc|C|\), if $\prc|C|'$ occurs verbatim in \prc|C|.
%
%For convenience, w
We also define the following sets of variables.

\begin{definition}[\(\Occ\), \(\Out\) and \(\In\)]%
\label{def:in-out-occ}
We define the \emph{variables occurring in an expression} \prc|e| by:
\[\begin{aligned}[t]
\Occ(\prc|x|) =\prc|x| & \Occ(\prc|op(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|) = \cup_{i = 1}^n \Occ(\prc|e$_i$|) & \Occ(\prc|t[e]|) =\prc|t| \cup \Occ(\prc|e|) & 		\Occ(\emph{val}) =\emptyset %& \Occ(\prc|f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|) & = \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|
\end{aligned}\]
\noindent
The set \(\Occ(\prc|C|)\) (\resp $\Out(\prc|C|)$, $\In(\prc|C|)$) of variables \emph{occurring} in (\resp \emph{modified} by, \emph{used} by) a program \prc|C| is defined in \autoref{table:def-out-in-occ}.
We let $|\Occ(\prc|C|)|$ be the cardinal of \(\Occ(\prc|C|)\).

\subsubsection{Security-Flow Matrices for Non-interference Violation}
\label{subsec:sfg}

The \lname logic relies fundamentally on its ability to analyze data-flow dependencies between variables occurring in commands.
In this section, we define the principles of this dependency analysis, founded on the theory of \emph{security-flow matrices}, and how it maps to the presented language.
This dependency analysis is reminiscent of the one we developed to distribute loops~\cite{aubert202213}%
%, and was influenced by a large body of works related to static analysis~\cite{Abel20002,Kristiansen2005b,Lee2001,Aubert2022b,Jones2009}
% and optimization~\cite{moyen20172}.
.
We assume %the reader is familiar
familiarity with monoids and matrices addition. % and of graphs (\eg their union).

A security-flow matrix $\sfm{\prc|C|}$
for a %given
command \prc|C|
is a hollow matrix (\ie a matrix with only $\nv$ on the diagonal\footnote{This choice is clarified after \autoref{def:violation}.}) over a monoid %\footnote{The original data-flow requires a semi-ring, but product is not necessary for our purpose here.}
with an implicit choice of a denumeration of \(\Occ(\prc|C|)\)\footnote{We will use the order in which the variables occur in the program as their implicit order.}% most of the time.% \clem{Get back to this: we should strive to have this all of the time, and get rid of that "most of the time".
%	}\label{footnote:order-variables}}.

\begin{definition}[Security monoid]
The \emph{security monoid} is \((\{\nv, \vi\}, \max)\), with \(\nv < \vi\).
\end{definition}

This monoid is isomorphic to the two-element Boolean algebra with only the disjunction, with \(\vi\) representing a possible (non-interference) violation that cannot be erased.

\begin{definition}[Security-flow matrix]%
\label{def:sfg}
Given a program \prc|C|, its \emph{security-flow matrix} $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ is a $|\Occ(\prc|C|)|\times |\Occ(\prc|C|)|$ matrix over the security monoid, whose construction is the object of \autoref{subsec:construction}.
%
For \(\prc|x|, \prc|y| \in \Occ(\prc|C|)\), we write $\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)$ for the coefficient in $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ at the row corresponding to the \emph{in-variable} $\prc|x|$ and column corresponding to the \emph{out-variable} $\prc|y|$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Violation]%
\label{def:violation}
Given \prc|C|, its security-flow matrix $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ and a class assignment \(\ell\), \prc|C| \emph{has a violation} if there exists \prc|x| and \prc|y| such that $\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)=\vi$ and either \(\lvl{\prc|y|} < \lvl{\prc|x|}\) or \(\lvl{\prc|y|} \orth \lvl{\prc|x|}\):

\begin{center}
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \hdots & \prc|y| & \hdots \\
\vdots & \ddots &      &  \iddots \\
\prc|x|  &     & \vi    & \\
\vdots & \iddots &      & \ddots
\end{pNiceMatrix}
\implies \prc|C| \text{ has a violation if }
\lvl{\prc|y|} < \lvl{\prc|x|}$ or $\lvl{\prc|y|} \orth \lvl{\prc|x|}$\text{.}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

%Stated negatively, the program will not have a violation (at least for those variables and levels, refer to \autoref{sec:soundness} for a complete definition of non-interference) if the level of \(\prc|x|\) is not greater than the level of \(\prc|y|\), or if they are of equal level.
%Note that if the levels of \(\prc|x|\) and \(\prc|y|\) are different but not ordered by \(<\), then \prc|C| has a violation.
Since \(\lvl{\prc|x|} < \lvl{\prc|x|}\) and $\lvl{\prc|x|} \orth \lvl{\prc|x|}$ are always false, there is no point %in computing $\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|x|)$, hence there is no need to
keeping track of the values on the diagonal: this is why hollow matrices are enough.
This is also confirmed by the intuition: it does not make sense to track data \enquote{leaking} from a variable to itself.

How a security-flow matrix is constructed by induction over the command is explained in \autoref{subsec:construction}.
To avoid resizing matrices whenever additional variables are considered, we identify $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ with its embedding in any larger matrix, \ie we abusively call the security-flow matrix of \prc|C| any matrix containing $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ (up to rows swapping and columns swapping) and containing \(\nv\) otherwise, implicitly viewing the additional rows and columns as variables not occuring in \prc|C|.
Visually, this means that the following matrices are all viewed as $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ with \(\Occ(\prc|C|)=\{\prc|x|, \prc|y|\}\) and $\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)=\vi$:
\begin{center}
\hfill
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|x| & \prc|y|\\
\prc|x| &  \nv & \vi \\
\prc|y| & \nv & \cdot
\end{pNiceMatrix}$
\hfill
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|y|  & \prc|x|  & \prc|z| \\
\prc|y| & \nv      &  \nv     & \nv \\
\prc|x| & \vi      &  \nv     & \nv \\
\prc|z| & \nv      &  \nv     & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}$
\hfill
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|w| & \prc|x| & \prc|y|  \\
\prc|w| & \nv      &  \nv     & \nv \\
\prc|x| & \nv      &  \nv     & \vi \\
\prc|y| & \nv      &  \nv     & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}$
\hfill~
\end{center}
Continuing this example and using our compact presentation of information flow policy and class assignment as single Hasse diagram, \prc|C| would have a violation with the level assignments
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.3em, node distance=1.2cm]
\node (y) {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (x) [above of = y] {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\draw[->] (y) -- (x);
\end{tikzpicture}
and
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=2.3em, node distance=1.2cm]
\node (c1) {\(c_1\)};
\node (y) [above left of = c1] {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (x) [above right of = c1] {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\node (c2) [above right of = y] {\(c_2\)};
\draw[->] (c1) -- (x);
\draw[->] (c1) -- (y);
\draw[->] (x) -- (c2);
\draw[->] (y) -- (c2);
\end{tikzpicture}, but would be free of violation with \(\lvl{\prc|x|} = \lvl{\prc|y|}\) or \begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.3em, node distance=1.2cm]
\node (y) {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (x) [above of = y] {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\draw[->] (y) -- (x);
\end{tikzpicture}.

\subsubsection{Constructing Security-Flow Matrices}%
\label{subsec:construction}

The security-flow matrix of a command is constructed by induction%on the structure of the command
, using the security monoid.
\autoref{sec:examples} gathers additional examples with longer discussion.

% \(\SSG\).
%We use the monoid $(\{\nv,1,\vi\},\max,\times)$ to represent dependencies:
%$\vi$ represents \emph{violation}, $1$ represents \emph{propagation}, and  $\cdot$ represents \emph{reinitialization}.

\paragraph{Base Cases: Assignment and Skip}
The security-flow matrix for an assignment \prc|C| simply tracks flows from $\In(\prc|C|)$ to $\Out(\prc|C|)$:

\begin{definition}[Assignment]%
\label{def:assignment}
Given an assignment \prc|C|, we define \(\sfm{\prc|C|}\) by:
\[
\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)=
\begin{dcases*}
\vi &  if $\prc|x| \in \In(\prc|C|)$, $\prc|y| \in \Out(\prc|C|)$ and $\prc|x| \neq \prc|y|$\\
\nv & otherwise
\end{dcases*}
\]
%corresponding to a possible \emph{violation}, \emph{propagation} and \emph{reinitialization} cases.
%	\begin{numcases}{\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)=}
%	\vi & if $\prc|x| \in \Out(\prc|C|)$ and $\prc|y| \in \In(\prc|C|)$\tag{Violation}\\
%		1 & if  $\prc|x|=\prc|y$ and  $|\prc|x| \notin \Out(\prc|C|)$ \tag{Propagation}\\
%		\nv & otherwise \tag{Reinitialization}
%	\end{numcases}
\end{definition}

\caption{Statement Examples, Sets, Representations of their Possible %Non-interference
Violation(s).\label{Fig_threecases}}
\label{fig:dependences}
\end{figure*}

We illustrate in \autoref{Fig_threecases} some basic cases: %.  and their representations as matrices.
%note that in the case of violations, $\In(\prc|C|)$ is exactly the set of variables that are sources of a violation,
%while $\Out(\prc|C|)$ is the set of variables that are targets of violations.
% \clem{Not sure I understand / it brings much. We can give a heads-up on \autoref{lem:sfma}.}
%
we consider an array a single entity, and that changing one value in it means being able to access it completely.
More precisely, \prc|t[i]| on the left-hand side of an assignment is a violation if \(\lvl{\prc|t|} > \lvl{\prc|i|}\) (\resp \(\lvl{\prc|t|} \orth \lvl{\prc|i|}\)). Indeed, it implies that a lower-class (\resp orthogonal-class) variable (\prc|i|) can decide where to write in a higher-class (\resp orthogonal-class) variable (\prc|t|).
However, \prc|t[i]| as an expression (\eg on the right-hand side of an assignment or in a condition, as discussed in \autoref{sssec:correction}) is acceptable as long as the variable(s) storing the result of this calculation or dependent on that condition's truth value have class higher or equal to \prc|t| and \prc|i| classes.
%even if \(\lvl{\prc|t|} > \lvl{\prc|i|}\),
%since \prc|t| is \enquote{consulting} \(\prc|i|\) to perform internal calculation without exposing its values to \prc|i|'s class.
%\clem{Two comments: I don't think we use quotes around use the rest of the time + introduce / re-use the "orthogonal-class" %expression?}

%The security-flow matrix for \prc|skip| is simply an empty matrix:

\begin{definition}[Skip]
We let $\sfm{\prc|skip|}$ be the matrix with $0$ rows and columns.
\end{definition}

%Since we identify $\sfm{\prc|skip|}$ with its embeddings, it is hence the matrix containing only \(\nv\)s on any set of variables.
Identifying $\sfm{\prc|skip|}$ with its embeddings, it is the empty matrix of any size.

\paragraph{Composition as a Commutative Operation }

The security-flow matrix for a composition of commands is an abstraction that allows manipulating a sequence of commands as one command with its own matrix.

\begin{definition}[Composition]
We let $\sfm{\prc|C$_1$;$\cdots$;C$_n$|}$
be $\sfm{\prc|C$_1$|} + \cdots + \sfm{\prc|C$_n$|}$.
\end{definition}

\caption{Security-Flow Matrix of Compositions.}\label{fig:composition}
\end{figure}

The composition of commands \prc|C$_1$| and \prc|C$_2$|---themselves already the result of compositions of assignments involving disjoint variables---is illustrated in~\autoref{fig:composition}.
Two important observations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item %To the best of our knowledge\clem{CHECK ME / REPHRASE}, I think it is too strong to say this for type systems; For other NI systems, maybe?
Some existing approaches might consider \prc|C$_1$;C$_2$| as free of violation even if \(\lvl{\prc|z|} < \lvl{\prc|y|}\), since \(\prc|z = 0|\) will wipe out the content of \prc|z| and \enquote{cancel} the violation introduced by \prc|z = y|.
The intuition is that an attacker observing the output (or even all the final values) cannot deduce anything about \prc|z|'s value (and, transitively, about the value of the higher-class \prc|y|) once the computation is over.
Our \enquote{once a violation, always a violation} approach ignores the fact that \enquote{ultimately}, this violation may be hidden--the anytime non-interference guarantee is discussed in \autoref{sec:soundness}. %, and its applications in \autoref{sec:case-study}.
\item Interestingly, $\sfm{\prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|} = \sfm{\prc|C$_2$;C$_1$|}$ since composition is interpreted as a sum of matrices over our \emph{commutative} security monoid.
While previous flow-based approaches~\cite{aubert20222,aubert20232,jones2009} requires semi-ring because composition was handled \emph{via} product of matrices, the current set-up simplifies the machinery precisely to keep track of past violations.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{A Correction for Implicit Flows}%
\label{sssec:correction}

To account for implicit flows, branchings and loops require a \emph{correction}. % to compute their security flow-matrices.
The main idea is that interpreting \prc|if e then C$_1\;$ else C$_2$| (\resp \prc|while e do C|) require to record that all the variables modified in \prc|C$_1$| and \prc|C$_2$| (\resp in \prc|C|) depend on the variables \emph{occurring} in \(\prc|e|\) (as opposed to the assignment considering the variables \emph{used} by \prc|C|).

\begin{definition}[Correction]%
\label{def:correction}
The \emph{correction $\corr{\prc|e|}_{\prc|C|}$ of an expression \prc|e| on a program \prc|C|} is
\[
\corr{\prc|e|}_{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|,\prc|y|)=
\begin{dcases*}
\vi &  if $\prc|x| \in \Occ(\prc|e|)$, $\prc|y| \in \Out(\prc|C|)$ and \(\prc|x| \neq \prc|y|\)\\
\nv & otherwise
\end{dcases*}
\]
\end{definition}

Intuitively, the correction states that if the variable \prc|y| is modified in the body of either branch of the branching or in the body of the loop and \(\prc|x|\) occurs in the expression, then there is a violation if \(\lvl{\prc|y|} < \lvl{\prc|x|}\) or \(\lvl{\prc|y|} \orth \lvl{\prc|x|}\).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0pt}

\end{pNiceMatrix}$}
\end{wrapfigure}
%\noindent\begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
% We want (and have) the indent here.
As an example, let us use \autoref{fig:composition} to construct \(\corr{\prc|w > x|}_{\prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|}\), \eg \prc|w > x|'s correction for \prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|.
Variables \prc|w| and \prc|x|, through the expression \prc|w > x|, control the values of \prc|w|, \prc|x| and \prc|z| since \prc|C$_1$| and \prc|C$_2$| set those values, and their execution depend on it, giving:
%\end{minipage}
%\hfill
%\begin{minipage}{.25\textwidth}
%	$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
%		& \prc|w| & \prc|x| & \prc|y| & \prc|z|\\
%		\prc|w| & \nv & \vi & \nv & \vi \\
%		\prc|x| & \vi & \nv & \nv & \vi \\
%		\prc|y| & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv \\
%		\prc|z| & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv
%	\end{pNiceMatrix}$
%\end{minipage}

Observe also that in \(\corr{\prc|t[i] != x|}_{\prc|C|}\) the variables \prc|t|, \prc|i| and \prc|x| would be marked as controlling the variables occurring in \(\Out(\prc|C|)\).
However, no constraint would be imposed between the classes of \prc|t|, \prc|i| and \prc|x|, since they would all be required to flow into classes that are higher or equal to theirs.

\paragraph{Conditionals and Loops}

Following our previous observation, branchings and loops are interpreted similarly.

\begin{definition}[Branching]%
\label{def:if}
We let $\sfm{\prc|if e then C$_1\;$ else C$_2$|}$
be $\sfm{\prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|} + \corr{\prc|e|}_{\prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|}$.
\end{definition}

\newsavebox\ifconectwo
\begin{lrbox}{\ifconectwo}

if (w > x)
then  w = w + x;
z = y + 2
else  x = y * 2;
z = 0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{lrbox}

\noindent %\begin{minipage}{.33\textwidth}
Adding \(\corr{\prc|w > x|}_{\prc|C$_1$;C$_2$|}\) to $\sfm{\prc|C$_1$|} + \sfm{\prc|C$_2$|}$ from \autoref{fig:composition}, we obtain:

\noindent\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0pt}
\raisebox{0pt}[\dimexpr\height-0.6\baselineskip\relax]{
\scalebox{.9}{$\mathbb{M} \left(~ \usebox\ifconectwo

\prc|x| & \vi & \nv & \nv & \vi \\
\prc|y| & \nv & \vi & \nv & \vi \\
\prc|z| & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}\text{.}$}
}\end{wrapfigure}

Observe that there is a violation if \(\lvl{\prc|w|} < \lvl{\prc|x|}\) or \(\lvl{\prc|w|} \orth \lvl{\prc|x|}\) from the statement $\prc|w = w + x|$,
and that there is a violation if \(\lvl{\prc|x|} < \lvl{\prc|w|}\) or \(\lvl{\prc|x|} \orth \lvl{\prc|w|}\).
The latter comes from the fact that the value of \(\prc|w|\) will decide if \(\prc|x = y * 2|\) will execute through the expression.
To be free of violations, such a program must be given a class assignment satisfying \(\lvl{\prc|w|} = \lvl{\prc|x|}\) and the other constraints recorded in the matrix.

\begin{definition}[Loop]

\subsection{Capturing Anytime Non-Interference}%
\label{sec:soundness}

In the seminal work of Volpano et al.~\cite[pg.~173]{VolpanoI1996}, \enquote{\textins{s}oundness \textins{wa}s formulated as a kind of noninterference property. \textins{\dots I}f a variable $v$ has security \textins{class $c$}%level $\tau$
, then one can change the initial values of any variables whose security levels are not dominated by \textins{$c$}%$\tau$
, execute the program, and
the \emph{final value} of $v$ will be the same, \emph{provided the program terminates successfully}.} (our emphasis).
\emph{Anytime non-interference}, defined below and captured by \lname, inspects the values \emph{while the program is being executed}.
It allows us to \begin{enumerate*}
\item avoid making assumptions of program termination, or avoid waiting for termination, and
\item model attackers who are capable of observing updates to variables at class $c$ or lower.
\end{enumerate*}

First, we need to define a notion of \emph{timed} execution, which captures the idea that an external observer can see updates on variables below a particular security class in \enquote{real time}.

%We now give the definitions to formulate soundness in our set-up.
%\clem{Discuss how our notion here changes: not just input / output, it's "anytime" n-i.}

%First remember that we assumed a fixed order for the variables in \(\Occ(\prc|C|)\) given \prc|C|. %\footref{footnote:order-variables}.

%\begin{definition}[Command evaluation]
%	Given a program \prc|C| with \(|\Occ(\prc|C|)|=n\) variables \(\vec{\prc|x|}=\prc|x$_1, \hdots, $x$_n$|\) and \(n\) values \(\vec{v}=v_1, \hdots, v_n\)\footnote{Since arrays have a fixed size, we assume, for simplicity, that a variable \prc|x$_i$| representing an array of size $s$ is given a value $v_i = v_i^1, \hdots, v_i^s$.}, we write \(\prc|C|[%\vec{\prc|x|} \leftarrow
%		\vec{v}]\) for the program \prc|C| where the variable \(\prc|x$_i$|\) received the value \(v_i\) before execution, for \(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n\).
%We also write \(\prc|C|[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]\) if \begin{itemize}
%		\item \(\prc|C|[\vec{v}]\) terminates and
%		\item after executing all the commands in \(\prc|C|[\vec{v}]\), \(\prc|x$_i$|\) contains the value \(v_i'\), for \(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n\).
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Timed command execution]
Given
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item a program \prc|C| with variables \(\prc|x|_1, \hdots, \prc|x|_n\),
\item a class assignment \(\ell : \Occ(\prc|C|) \to \SC\),
\item a security class \(\scl{c} \in \SC\),
\item a \emph{time (counter)} \(t \in \mathbb{N}\),
\item and a value list \(\vec{v} = v_1, \hdots, v_n\),
\item[] % To align 2 and 5.
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
we write
\begin{itemize}
\item \(\prc|C|[\vec{v}]_0\) for the program \prc|C| where the variable \(\prc|x$_i$|\) was assigned \(v_i\)\footnote{Since arrays have a fixed size, we assume, for simplicity, that a variable \prc|x$_i$| representing an array of size $s$ is given a value $v_i = v_i^1, \hdots, v_i^s$.}, for \(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n\),
\item  \(\prc|C|[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]_t\) if, while executing the commands in \(\prc|C|[\vec{v}]_0\), \(\prc|x$_i$|\) contains the value \(v_i'\), for \(1 \leqslant i \leqslant n\) after variables at class \(\scl{c}\) or lower have been updated \(t\) times.
\end{itemize}
If, after \(t\) updates, variables at level \(\scl{c}\) or lower stop being updated, then we let, for all \(t' > t\), \(\prc|C|[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]_t = \prc|C|[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]_{t'}\).
\end{definition}

Deciding whether variables will be updated after \(t\) may be difficult in all generality, but simple checks as \eg testing for membership in \(\Out(\prc|C|')\) for \(\prc|C|' \subseteq \prc|C|\) the subprogram of \prc|C| that remains to be executed can give in some cases a rapid answer.
%Being able to decide this property is in any case easier than deciding termination, as it is implied by it. \clem{check me.}
%\neea{don't understand this sentence. Second: termination is also easy in many cases}

We give below a program along with a class assignment (where the security class \(\scl{c}\) is grayed out) and two tables containing the value held by memory locations at time counter \(t\).
The initial value lists are \(\vec{v_1} = \prc|1|, \prc|2|, \prc|3|, \prc|4|\) and \(\vec{v_2} = \prc|5|, \prc|2|, \prc|3|, \prc|4|\).
Observe that \(t\) is incremented only when values held by variables at or below \(\scl{c}\) (with the grayed out background) are updated.

\end{tabular}

\noindent Hence we have \(\prc|C|[\vec{v_1} \rightarrow \vec{v_1'}]_1\) and \(\prc|C|[\vec{v_2} \rightarrow \vec{v_2'}]_0 = \prc|C|[\vec{v_2} \rightarrow \vec{v_2'}]_1\) for \(\vec{v_1'} = \prc|1|, \prc|6|, \prc|3|, \prc|0|\) and \(\vec{v_2'} = \prc|7|, \prc|2|, \prc|3|, \prc|5|\).

\begin{definition}[Up-to \(\scl{c}\) equivalence]
Given \prc|C|, a class assignment \(\ell : \Occ(\prc|C|) \to \SC\) and \(\scl{c} \in \SC\), two values lists \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\) are \emph{up-to \(\scl{c}\) equivalent}, written \(\vec{v} \upce{\scl{c}} \vec{w}\) if \(\ell(\prc|x$_i$|) \leqslant \scl{c} \implies v_i=w_i\).
\end{definition}

Intuitively, two value lists are up-to \(\scl{c}\) equivalent if they agree on the values of the variables of class \(\scl{c}\) or lower: re-using the example above, we have \(\vec{v_1} \upce{\lvl{\prc|y|}} \vec{v_2}\) but  \(\vec{v_1} \nupce{\lvl{\prc|w|}} \vec{v_2}\).

We can now formally state the anytime non-interference property:

\begin{definition}[Anytime non-interference]%
\label{def:com-ni}
A program \prc|C| is \emph{anytime non-interfering for \(\ell : \Occ(\prc|C|) \to \SC\)} if for all security class \(\scl{c} \in \SC\), for all time \(t \in \mathbb{N}\) and all %two values list
\(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\),
\[
\vec{v}\upce{\scl{c}} \vec{w}, \prc|C|[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]_t, \prc|C|[\vec{w} \rightarrow \vec{w'}]_t \implies \vec{v'}\upce{\scl{c}} \vec{w'}\text{.}
\]
\end{definition}

Note that we can conclude that the program above is \emph{not} anytime non-interfering for the given class assignment, since \(\vec{v_1} \upce{\lvl{\prc|y|}} \vec{v_2}\) but \(\vec{v_1'} \nupce{\lvl{\prc|y|}} \vec{v_2'}\): we had already noted, using \lname, that \(\ell(\prc|w|) = \ell(\prc|x|)\) was required for this program to be anytime non-interfering.
%Informally, anytime non-interference states that changing the value received by higher-or-incomparable-class \clem{Intro this terminology / use it consistently?} variables does not impact the final value of lower-class variables.
Indeed, this property has a natural equivalent in \lname, and can be established using it:

\begin{definition}[Non-interfering class assignment]%
\label{def:level-ni}
Given $\sfm{\prc|C|}$, a class assignment \(\ell\) is \emph{anytime non-interfering for \prc|C|} iff \prc|C| has no violation (\autoref{def:violation}).
\end{definition}

Note that the trivial class assignment \(\scl{i}\) that assigns to all values the same security class \(c_i\) is always non-interfering, since in that case \(\scl{i}(\prc|y|) < \scl{i}(\prc|x|)\) and \(\scl{i}(\prc|y|) \orth \scl{i}(\prc|x|)\) are always false.
Conversely, any program is anytime non-interfering for \(\scl{i}\), since value lists are up-to \(c_i\) equivalent if and only if they are equal.

\begin{restatable}[Correspondance]{theorem}{corrthm}\label{thm:corr}
A program \prc|C| is anytime non-interfering for \(\ell\) (\autoref{def:com-ni}) if and only if \(\ell\) is anytime non-interfering for \prc|C| (\autoref{def:level-ni}).
\end{restatable}

The proof is detailed in \autoref{app:proof}, it leverages the idea that only assignments and corrections can introduce \(\vi\) in security-flow matrices.
This mirror the idea that only assignments, loops and branchings can trigger the update of an element in a value list, hence connecting the two definitions of anytime non-interference.
An important assumption is that expressions are falsifiable, \eg that if \(\prc|x$_i$| \in \Occ(\prc|e|)\), then there exists at least one value for \(\prc|v$_i$|\) that will make \prc|e| evaluate to \prc|false|, and at least one value that will make it evaluate to \prc|true|.

\subsection{Interpreting Function Calls in an Anytime Non-Interfering Context}%
\label{sec:fct-calls}

We detail below how function calls can be integrated into our analysis.
The main challenge is to nail down the correct interpretation of anytime non-interference for functions that may have side effects or, conversely, that may return a value with a lower class than its inputs.
We start, as a warm-up, by discussing how to add to \lname pure functions, then functions with side effects, before finally discussing the meaning of anytime non-interference for functions.

\subsubsection{Warm-Up: Pure Functions}%
\label{ssec:pure-fct}

First, let us discuss how \emph{pure} functions can be integrated into \lname.
The first steps are to add \(\emph{fun}(\emph{exp}, \hdots, \emph{exp})\) to the expressions, let \prc|f| and \prc|g| range over function, and to let
%\begin{align*}
\(\Occ(\prc|f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|)  = \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|\)
%	&& \text{ and } &&
%	\sfm{\prc|x = f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|} = \sfm{\prc|x = f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|}
%\end{align*}
for \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| a freshly introduced variable unique to \prc|f|, \prc|e$_1$|, $\hdots$, \prc|e$_n$|\footnote{This point is clarified at the end of this subsection.}.
Let us illustrate those first steps by interpreting two programs involving function calls.
Simply using the definition of \(\Occ(\prc|f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|)\), and without changing Definitions~\ref{def:assignment} or \ref{def:if}, we have: % for example

{
\addtolength\tabcolsep{2pt}
\centering
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l c p{40mm}}
\prc|C| & $\Out(\prc|C|)$, $\In(\prc|C|)$
& $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ \\
\hline
\prc|x = f(y)|
& %
$\begin{aligned}
\Out(\prc|C|) &=\{\prc|x|\}          \\
\In(\prc|C|)  &=\{\prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$|\}
\end{aligned}$
& %
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col,baseline=c]
& \prc|x| & \prc|y| & \prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$| \\
\prc|x| &  \nv & \nv & \nv \\
\prc|y| & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$| & \vi & \nv & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}$
\\
\begin{lstlisting}
if (g(x, y) > x)
then y = z
else skip
\end{lstlisting}
\prc||
& %
$\begin{aligned}
\Out(\prc|C|) &=\{\prc|y|\}  \\
\In(\prc|C|)  &=\{\prc|g$_{\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y}}$|, \prc|x|, \prc|z|\}
\end{aligned}$
& %
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col,baseline=c]
& \prc|x| & \prc|y| & \prc|z| & \prc|g$_{\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y}}$| \\
\prc|x| &  \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv \\
\prc|y| & \nv & \nv & \nv  & \nv \\
\prc|z| & \nv & \vi & \nv  & \nv \\
\prc|g$_{\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y}}$| & \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv
\end{pNiceMatrix}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
}

It may seem surprising that \prc|y| does not occur in the \(\In(\prc|C|)\) sets, considering that its value may affect the output of the function call, hence controlling indirectly the out-variables.
This design choice \emph{lets the class assignment handle this decision}. The core idea is that the level assignment \(\ell : \Occ(\prc|C|) \to \SC\) now additionally needs to assign a class (or a collection of constraints) to each \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| variable. Multiple design choices exist, \eg

\begin{itemize}
\item \(\ell(\prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|)\) can be a constant class \(\scl{c}\), reflecting the fact that all function outputs should be assigned the same security class regardless of the classes assigned to its inputs,
\item \(\ell(\prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|)\) can be a function of \(\lvl{\prc|x|}\) for \(\prc|x| \in \Occ(\mathtt{e}_1) \cup \cdots \cup \Occ(\mathtt{e}_n)\) such as the supremum, the infimum (written \(\max\) and \(\min\)), the first projection \(\pi_1\), etc.
\item \(\ell(\prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|)\) could otherwise depends on the particular structure of \(\vec{\mathtt{e}}\), \eg be the supremum if a variable whose class is above a particular threshold occurs, a constant otherwise, etc.
\end{itemize}

This adds \enquote{external} constraints to our definition of violation: \emph{in addition} of having to provide a level assignment meeting \autoref{def:violation}'s condition, one has to check that the constraints given on the classes of the \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| variables are met.
As an additional benefit, this allows to handle functions with \(0\) parameters, since the flow from the argument(s, or lack thereof) to the function's output need not to be tracked in the security-flow matrix.

Going back to our first example above, if we consider that \prc|f|'s output class must be strictly higher than its input class, then we have the additional requirement that \(\lvl{\prc|f$_{\mathtt{x}}$|} > \lvl{\prc|x|}\) for each variable \prc|x| such that \prc|f$_{\mathtt{x}}$| occurs in $\sfm{\prc|C|}$.
Hence, our first program \prc|C| would be free of violations with
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.3em, node distance=1cm]
\node (y) {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (fy) [above of = y] {\(\lvl{\prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$|}\)};
\node (x) [above of = fy] {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\draw[->] (y) -- (fy);
\draw[->] (fy) -- (x);
\end{tikzpicture}
and
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.3em, node distance=1cm]
\node (y) {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (fy) [above of = y] {\(\lvl{\prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$|} = \lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\draw[->] (y) -- (fy);
\end{tikzpicture}
, but it would have a violation with
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=2.3em, node distance=1.2cm]
\node (c) {\(c\)};
\node (y) [above left of = c] {\(\lvl{\prc|y|}\)};
\node (fy) [above right of = c] {\(\lvl{\prc|f$_{\mathtt{y}}$|}\)};
\node (x) [above left of = fy] {\(\lvl{x}\)};
\draw[->] (c) -- (y);
\draw[->] (c) -- (fy);
\draw[->] (fy) -- (x);
\draw[->] (y) -- (x);
\end{tikzpicture}, even if this latter class assignment would have met the requirements of \autoref{def:violation}.

The rest of the interpretation is the same, even $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ remains a $|\Occ(\prc|C|)|\times |\Occ(\prc|C|)|$ matrix, since \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| variables are defined as occurring in \prc|C|.
The only tedious aspect is to handle the introduction of \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| variables elegantly.
One would want \eg
\begin{align*}
\Occ(\prc|f(x + y))|)  &=  \Occ(\prc|f(x - y))|) && \text{ and } & \Occ(\prc|f(x + 3))|)  &=  \Occ(\prc|f(x - 5))|)
\shortintertext{but relying on \emph{the set} \(\Occ(\mathtt{e}_1) \cup \cdots \cup \Occ(\mathtt{e}_n)\) would not be correct, as one would want \eg}
\Occ(\prc|f(x, y))|) & \neq  \Occ(\prc|f(y, x))|) && \text{ and } & \Occ(\prc|f(x, x, y))|)  &\neq  \Occ(\prc|f(x, y, y))|)\text{.}
\end{align*}
A more precise definition of function type signature, capable of handling repetition and swapping in the argument list, would be required but presents no challenge.

\subsubsection{Completing the Picture: Functions With Side Effects}%
\label{ssec:impure-fct}

Our development so far assumes that the only way a function can leak information is through its return value.
Considering functions with side effects (such as \prc|print|, \prc|read|, accessing a non-local variable, passing argument by reference, etc.) increases \lname's expressivity, but requires to discuss more precisely what is meant by anytime non-interfering function calls.

%has two advantages:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item First, it makes \lname more expressive, and closer from having applicative effects, \clem{rephrase}
%	\item Second, it allows to discuss a blind spot: \emph{what does it mean to assert that a function is anytime non-interfering?}
%\end{enumerate}

%The second item will be discussed in more detail at the end of this section, % in \autoref{ssec:ani-fct},
We first focus on how effects can be integrated into \lname. %, and begin by wondering \enquote{should this information be stored in $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ or conveyed by the class assignment?}
Interestingly, the column \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| always remains empty, since the variale \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| will never be in an \(\Out\) set (it never \enquote{receives} a value).
Hence, we can use its out-variable to store information about its possible side-effects.
To this end, we now \enquote{split} \prc|f$_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| into \prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| (on the row) and \prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| (on the column) for each \enquote{signature} \prc|f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)|.
This convention is illustrated in \autoref{ex:fct} with another example of \emph{pure} functions.

%To account for effects, the expression \(\emph{fun}(\emph{exp}, \hdots, \emph{exp})\) should now be treated as a \emph{command \emph{and} an expression}.
%We then edit the definition of \(\sfm{\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|}\) to get:
%
%\begin{align*}
%	\sfm{\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|}  =
%	\begin{dcases}
%		\sfm{\prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$ = $\vec{\mathtt{e}}$|} & \text{if} \Occ(\vec{\mathtt{e}}) \neq \emptyset\\
%		\sfm{\prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$ = f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|} & \text{otherwise}\\
%	\end{dcases}
%	&& %\text{ and } &&
%	\sfm{\prc|x = f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|} = \sfm{\prc|x = f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|} + \sfm{\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|}
%\end{align*}

%We now require \eg \(\sfm{\prc|x = f(y)|}\) to be our previous interpretation of \(\sfm{\prc|x = f(y)|}\), to which is added \(\sfm{\prc|f(y)|}\), as exemplified below.


To account for effects, the expression \(\emph{fun}(\emph{exp}, \hdots, \emph{exp})\) should now be treated as a \emph{command \emph{and} an expression}.
We then edit the definition of the variables occuring in \prc|f(e$_1$, $\hdots$,e$_n$)| (henceforth simply denoted \prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|) and in $\vec{\mathtt{e}}$ to get a more complete picture:
\begin{align*}
\Occ(\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|) & = \prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|
%	& \Out(\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|) & = \prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|
& \Occ(\vec{\mathtt{e}}) & =
\begin{dcases}
\Occ(\mathtt{e}_1) \cup \cdots \cup \Occ(\mathtt{e}_n) & \text{ if } n > 0\\
\prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\emptyset}$| & \text{ otherwise}\\
\end{dcases}
\shortintertext{with the \enquote{otherwise} case above handling functions with 0 parameters. We then let}
\sfm{\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)|} & = \sfm{\prc|skip|}
\hspace{-1.25em} & \sfmb{\prc|C|} & =
\sum_{\mathclap{\prc|f($\vec{\mathtt{e}}$)| \subseteq \Occ(\prc|C|)}} \sfm{\prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$ = $\; \vec{\mathtt{e}}$|} + \sfm{\prc|C|}
\end{align*}
and study \sfmb{\prc|C|} moving forward, where the above definition interprets all function calls as assignments and then interpret the rest of the program as before, skipping the commands calling a function without using their return value.
\autoref{fig:fct-effect} gathers examples of programs involving effectul functions.
The last example follows our definitions, but may be hard to unpack: the critical point is to see that \prc|g$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\emptyset}$| controlling the values of \prc|x| and \prc|g$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\emptyset}$| reflects the fact that \prc|g| \enquote{on its own} (\ie without any input) will decide of its output and hence if \prc|x = 0| will execute.

%We get, for example:

\caption{Statement Examples, Interpretation and Sets -- Involving Effects}%
\label{fig:fct-effect}
\end{figure*}


This interpretation entails the following two principles:

\begin{itemize}
\item An effectful function is completely transparent: the first example of \autoref{fig:fct-effect} requires \(\ell(\prc|g$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\mathtt{x}, \mathtt{y}}$|) \geqslant \max (\ell(\mathtt{y}), \ell(\mathtt{x}))\), \eg as if \prc|g| is revealing all the data it is processing.
\item A function can nevertheless have \(\ell(\prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$|)\) be less than or orthogonal to the level of its arguments. This means that a function can have a return value that is independent of its arguments, \eg a \prc|success| or \prc|failure| code in displaying the arguments at the screen.
\end{itemize}


Those principles can be both desirable and are not incompatible.
Indeed, a program

\newsavebox\ifsecret
\begin{lrbox}{\ifsecret}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape]
success = print(secret);
if(success==0) then x++
else x--
\end{lstlisting}
\end{lrbox}

\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}
\noindent
\usebox\ifsecret
\end{minipage}
with the class assignment
\hspace{-4.15em}
\begin{minipage}{.37\textwidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}[anchor=base, baseline=1.3em, node distance=.8cm]
\node (y) {\(\lvl{\prc|success|} = \lvl{\prc|print$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{secret}}$|}\)};
\node (fy) [above of = y] {\(\lvl{\prc|x|}\)};
\node (x) [above of = fy] {\(\lvl{\prc|secret|} = \lvl{\prc|print$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\mathtt{secret}}$|} \)};
\draw[->] (y) -- (fy);
\draw[->] (fy) -- (x);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{minipage}

\noindent should be considered as anytime non-interfering: a user having access to \prc|secret|'s class can see its value be displayed on the screen, but an attacker having access to at most \prc|x|'s class cannot infer \prc|secret|'s value, despite being able to access the return value of \prc|print(secret)|---which is constantly set to the lowest class available.
%However, this interpretation presents
Three challenges remain:
\begin{itemize}
\item The intuitive reading of our security-flow matrices is lost. For example, since \(\prc|y| \notin \In(\prc|x = f(y))|)\), \(\sfmb{\prc|x = f(y)|}(\prc|x|, \prc|y|) \neq \vi\), and \prc|y| is not recorded as impacting the value of \prc|x|.
This design choice is a \emph{feature}, as it does not \enquote{force} \prc|y| to control \prc|x|'s value when processed through \prc|f|: this allows finer constraints on the level of \prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{y}}$|. % However, this design choice requires to account for information not stored in our security-flow matrices.
\item It rigidly assumes that functions with side effects will reveal all their data at all times. This conservative approach is also a feature, but could be tuned by refining how constraints for \prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\vec{\mathtt{e}}}$| class assignments are recorded.
\item Developing a definition of anytime non-interference for programs with side effects (\autoref{def:com-ni}) will requires to develop a notion of external observer and of contextual equivalences, to correctly account for side effects and multiple communication channels.
\end{itemize}

We believe that those issues can be addressed by developing a richer theory that incorporates \emph{external knowledge on functions}, but reserve it for futur work.

\subsection{Practical Applications and Comparison}\label{sec:apps}

\subsubsection{Implementing the Anytime Non-interference Logic}\label{sec:analyzer}

We have created a prototype static analyzer \tool that implements the \lname logic.
The way matrices are composed in \lname is a key feature in making the analysis straightforward and efficient in practice.
Because composition order is irrelevant (\autoref{ex:composition-order}), it suffices to represent matrices as hash maps where composition is a union of maps.

The \tool analyzer accepts as input a program file written in \texttt{Java}.
It first translates the program into a parse tree (without optimizations), then analyzes the tree based on the rules of \lname.
The analysis is recursive over the methods of a \texttt{Java} class.
Obtaining a sound result requires a \prc|Java| method fully expressible in the \lname grammar (\autoref{fig:grammar}).
Commands that are not covered are highlighted by \tool and a partial result is given.
This handling assists the continued development of \lname, that already handles all the examples from~\autoref{sec:examples}.
%However, not all \texttt{Java} methods can be expressed in the grammar.
%In this case, \tool highlights visually the uncovered commands and outputs a partial result.
%This handling assists the continued development of \lname.

The outlined engineering choices have multiple advantages.
\texttt{Java} is frequently used to implement taint analyzers---an instance of non-interference fixed to two security classes---thus preparing \tool for a similar use case.
Since \prc|Java| compiles into bytecode, a kind of intermediate stack language, it enables program analysis at multiple language representations.
Although compiler optimizations could reduce the rate of false alarms, \eg by eliminating dead-code,
it would artificially inflate the analysis precision and thus we prefer our strategy.
Currently, \tool produces security-flow matrices for input programs.
The security flow matrices serve as basis for the extended applications, including the directions presented next.

\begin{description}
\item[Preservation of anytime non-interference.]
The \lname logic does not require much language structure; in particular, it assumes no language-specific syntactic features.
It is possible to map its grammar to numerous language representations, including intermediate representations and bytecode.
Comparing security-flow matrices of the same program at different representations enables analyzing preservation of security properties and detecting compilation issues.

\item[Security class inference.]
When security classes of variables are known partially, it is possible to infer them for all variables.
The inference requires a security flow-matrix, an information flow policy, and the known class assignments.
The inference is then framed as a satisfiability problem.
If a satisfactory assignment exists, it provides the security classes for all variables.
This application is similar to type inference, but requires no program as input.
Further, the same security flow-matrix can be easily evaluated against different information flow policies.

\item[Taint analysis.]
Taint analysis detects information flow issues between a high source and a low sink.
Aside a program, the sources and sinks are necessary, and analyzers commonly assume them as inputs.
The analyzers then compete on precision along various axes: path-coverage, syntax-coverage, context-sensitivity, false alarm rate, \etc.
Taint analysis can be formulated with security flow-matrices by analyzing source to sink connectivity. % in matrices.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Circumventing Termination-insensitivity via Distribution}
\label{termination}

Several real-world programs are non-terminating by design: web servers, embedded systems, and cyber-physical systems are among the examples.
While the programs can terminate, the termination events are infrequent and uncharacteristic of standard behavior.
Security analyses that can handle absence of termination are necessary to support such programs.

Anytime non-interference is termination-insensitive and compatible with the study of non-terminating programs.
However, termination-insensitivity is too weak to guard against untrusted code, \eg execution of the \prc|eval| command.
To offer an alleviation strategy, we present an approach to distribute security-sensitive computation.
This way, computations that require elevated security checks are handled separately from trusted code.

The idea is to pair \lname with a \emph{distribution analysis}~\cite{aubert20232} that detects disjoint program fragments.
That program fragments are disjoint means there exists no exchange of variable data between program fragments.
The judgement of disjointness is derived via a sound data-flow analysis that guarantees the property.
It is then permissible to execute the program fragments in separate execution contexts.
Although the distribution analysis naturally fits parallel computations, it is not restricted to this use case.
We conjecture it offers broader utility here in ensuring program security.

To combine the two analysis, we first analyze a program with \lname to identify its information flow constraints.
Then, we use the distribution analysis to identify the program's distribution potential.
Merging the results, the disjoint program fragments are assigned appropriate security classes.
The fragments are then allocated to different execution contexts, where each fragment can have a different security class designation.
This way, a program must not adhere to a monolithic security strategy, but can have a finer-grained strategy based on its content.
Due to paper scope, we reserve a detailed treatment for an extended version.

\subsubsection{Overview of Alternative and Related Approaches}\label{sec:related-works}

In language-based security, non-interference is commonly achieved through security types systems.
Type theoretic non-interference provides strong end-to-end confidentiality guarantees in a static and scalable way.
Initiating from the seminal work of Volpano et al.~\cite{VolpanoI1996}, security type systems have been extended to consider non-interference under numerous paradigms,
including concurrency~\cite{volpano1998,derakhshan2024,frumin2021}, formal reasoning~\cite{nelson2020,frumin2021}, compilation~\cite{barthe2004}, \etc.
A major challenge among the security type systems is \emph{declassification}, a kind of security downgrading operation~\cite{cecchetti2017}.
A \emph{downgrading} mechanisms permits elevating the security judgement around control-flow constructs then lowering it afterward.
In other words, information is allowed to flow contrary to the policy~\cite{cecchetti2017}.
The mechanism is necessary to increase the expressive power of security type systems;
however, downgrading is generally not safe~\cite{derakhshan2024} and eliminates the strong compositional guarantees of non-interference~\cite{cecchetti2017}.
In practice, security type systems are challenging to use because they modify the programming language.
A program must be annotated with security types and compiled with non-standard tools that can enforce the types~\cite{lamba2024}.
There is also a stark contrast in expressiveness of theoretical and practical systems;
\eg \cite{huang2014} categorically excludes implicit flows.

The Dependency Core Calculus (DCC)~\cite{abadi1999b} is conceptually related to \lname.
The DCC is an extension of lambda calculus, framed around the notion of data dependency, of which non-interference is an instance.
Though similarly rooted in dependency analysis, \lname originates from works of implicit computational complexity (ICC).
It is a refinement of~\cite{moyen20172,aubert20232}, but \lname required significant adjustment, particularly around matrix composition and functions.

ICC studies machine-free characterizations of complexity classes by introducing \emph{restrictions} in programming languages that in turn guarantee semantic properties~\cite{dallago2011}.
A critical idea is that ICC techniques can benefit from, and offer support in, other analytic domains.
The use of ICC techniques is such extended ways is an emerging research topic.
Previously, a non-interference type system provided a foundation for a series of complexity-theoretic results~\cite{marion2011,hainry2023}.
In the opposite direction, an ICC system was applied to cryptographic proofs~\cite{baillot2019}.
Although \lname has transformed from its origins to not enforce complexity bounds, it reinforces the bidirectional connection between ICC and language-based security.

\subsection{Conclusion: Strengths, Limitations and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Anytime non-interference detects violations at any program point, enforcing a finer-grained security policy than classic non-interference that is defined in terms of inputs and outputs.
We have presented \lname, a sound and compositional program logic, that captures the semantic security property of anytime non-interference in imperative programs.
The logic assigns security flow matrices to commands where the matrices represent the program's potentially interfering information flows.
The logic is lightweight and does not require program annotations, specialty compilers, and adds no run-time overhead.
Beside the compelling theory, \lname can be implemented to obtain automated security analysis in practice.
We have constructed a prototype static analyzer \tool to analyze \texttt{Java} programs.
By extension, \tool can support a range of applications, \eg security class inference, taint analysis, and preservation analysis.

Although the utility of \lname is encouraging, the development is still mainly theoretical.
Our immediate priority is enriching the syntax with effectful functions and object oriented constructs. %, to capture a larger class of programs.
For additional strength, we hope to mechanize the theory.
On the practical side, the prototype analyzer has room for enhancements.
It already computes security flow matrices, but an extension to the applications requires additional engineering steps.
With the current syntax coverage, experimental comparisons are still out of scope.
In the meantime, \lname provides an promising avenue for security analysis and future enhancements.

\subsection{Appendix A: Proof of %\autoref{lem:sfma} and
\autoref{thm:corr}}%
\label{app:proof}

A first useful observation is that if \(\prc|C|' \subseteq \prc|C|\), then \(\sfm{\prc|C|'}\) is included in \(\sfm{\prc|C|}\), in the sense that \(\sfm{\prc|C|'}(\prc|x|, \prc|y|) = \vi \implies \sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x|, \prc|y|) = \vi\).
This simple observation comes from our \enquote{additive} interpretation of commands, and is useful in proving our theorem.
One should also note that if \(\ell\) is not anytime non-interfering for \prc|C|', then any class assignment extending \(\ell\) to \(\Occ(\prc|C|)\) is not anytime non-interfering for \prc|C|.

\corrthm*

\begin{proof}
Let us assume given \prc|C|, \(\ell : \Occ(\prc|C|) \to \SC\), and that $\sfm{\prc|C|}$ has been computed.

\begin{description}
\item[For the if part] % l is non-interfering => C is non-interf. for l

Suppose that \(\ell\) is anytime non-interfering for \prc|C|, but that \prc|C| is not anytime non-interfering for \(\ell\). Then there must exist a class \(\scl{c} \in \SC\) and a counter \(t\) such that for some \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w'}\),
\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent%
\begin{align}
\vec{v} & \upce{\scl{c}} \vec{w} \label{eq:equi-level}\\
\prc|C|[\vec{v} &\rightarrow \vec{v'}]_t
\end{align}%
\begin{align}
\prc|C|[\vec{w} &\rightarrow \vec{w'}]_t \\
\vec{v'} &\nupce{\scl{c}} \vec{w'}
\end{align}
\end{multicols}

For \(\nupce{\scl{c}}\) the negation of \(\upce{\scl{c}}\), \ie there must exists \(\prc|x$_i$|\) such that
\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent
\begin{align}
\ell(\prc|x$_i$|) \leqslant \scl{c} \label{eq:xi-level}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
v_i' \neq w_i' \label{eq:re-assign}
\end{align}
\end{multicols}
For \autoref{eq:re-assign} to hold, it must be the case that \prc|C| contains a statement of the form \prc|x$_i$ = e$_1$|\footnote{Which can be \prc|t[e$_1^1$] = e$_1^2$|, in which case we let \(\Occ(\prc|e$_1$|) = \Occ(\prc|e$_1^1$|) \cup \Occ(\prc|e$_1^2$|)\) and carry out the same reasoning.}, possibly guarded by \prc|while| and \prc|if| statements using the expressions \(\prc|e$_2$|, \hdots, \prc|e$_n$|\).
Let \(\prc|x$_1$|, \hdots, \prc|x$_m$| = \bigcup_{j=1}^n \Occ(\prc|e$_j$|)\), and observe that since by  \autoref{eq:equi-level} our input value lists are up-to \(\scl{c}\) equivalent, it must be the case that there exists \(j \in \{1, \hdots, m\}\) such that
\begin{align}
\ell(\prc|x$_j$|) > \scl{c} \text{ or } \ell(\prc|x$_j$|) \orth \scl{c} \text{,}	\label{eq:xj-level}
\end{align}otherwise \autoref{eq:re-assign} could not hold\footnote{%
To be more rigorous, it could be the case that the classes of \(\prc|x$_1$|, \hdots, \prc|x$_m$|\) are $\scl{c}$ or below, but that \emph{one of them is itself} impacted by a variable at a higher or incomparable class. To handle, this case, one simply replaces \prc|x$_i$| and \prc|x$_j$| with those \enquote{problematic} variables, decreases the counter \(t\) to when the value of the one with the lower class was changed, and carry out the same reasoning, possibly repeating this step again. Since \(t\) decreased, we are guaranteed to identify \enquote{the first} anytime non-interference violation and to reason about it.}. Furthermore, thanks to \autoref{eq:xi-level} we know that
\begin{align}
j \neq i\text{.} \label{eq:i-not-j}
\end{align}

Let \(\prc|C|'\) be the smallest sub-program of \(\prc|C|\) where \prc|x$_i$ = e$_1$| occurs and either \(\prc|x$_j$| \in \Occ(\prc|e$_1$|)\) or \prc|x$_j$| occurs in the condition of a \prc|while| or \prc|if| command guarding the command \prc|x$_i$ = e$_1$|.
Intuitively, \(\prc|C|'\) has one of the following forms:
\vspace{.25em} % Weird, listing is eating the "g" of following.

\begin{minipage}[b]{.34\linewidth}% Yes, this is strange / ugly, but it's to make all listings aligned.
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, caption={(A)ssignment Case},label=listing-A,captionpos=b,abovecaptionskip=2.8em]
x$_i$ = $\cdots$ x$_j$ $\cdots$;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[b]{.3\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, caption={(L)oop Case},label=listing-L,captionpos=b]
while($\cdots$ x$_j$ $\cdots$){
$\cdots$
x$_i$ = $\cdots$;
$\cdots$
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[b]{.34\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape, caption={(B)ranching Case},label=listing-I, captionpos=b]
if($\cdots$ x$_j$ $\cdots$){
$\cdots$
x$_i$ = $\cdots$;
$\cdots$
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

Hence, \(\prc|x$_j$| \in \In(\prc|C|')\), \(\prc|x$_i$| \in \Out(\prc|C|')\), and
%we have
inspecting the rules of our interpretation allows us to conclude that
\(\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x$_j$|,\prc|x$_i$|)= \vi\)
%by \autoref{lem:sfma} and the fact that
, since \(\sfm{\prc|C|'}\) is included in \(\sfm{\prc|C|}\)\footnote{In brief terms, this comes from \autoref{table:def-out-in-occ}, remembering that \prc|x$_j$| being in the condition in the (L) and (B) cases implies that it is in \(\In(\prc|C|')\) and that a \(\vi\) was introduced between its in-variable and \prc|x$_i$|'s out-variable in \(\sfm{\prc|C|'}\).}.
%
Hence, \(\prc|x$_j$|, \prc|x$_i$| \in \Occ(\prc|C|)\) and \(j \neq i\) by \autoref{eq:i-not-j}, so we can use our assumption that \(\ell\) is non-interfering for \prc|C| to conclude that \(\ell(\prc|x$_j$|) \leqslant \ell(\prc|x$_i$|)\)--which, in conjunction with \autoref{eq:xi-level},  contradicts \autoref{eq:xj-level}.
\item[For the only if part] % C is non-interf. for l => l is non-interf.
Let us assume that \prc|C| is anytime non-interfering for \(\ell\), we need to prove that \(\ell\) is anytime non-interfering for \prc|C| \eg that \prc|C| has no violation: for all \(i\), \(j\),
\begin{align}
\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|x$_j$|, \prc|x$_i$|) & = \vi \label{eq:proof-assumption}
\shortintertext{implies}
\ell(\prc|x$_j$|) \leqslant \ell(\prc|x$_i$|) \text{.}\label{eq:proof-goal}
\end{align}
Note that if \(i = j\), then \autoref{eq:proof-assumption} cannot hold since security-flow matrices are hollow, hence we only have to prove the \(i \neq j\) case.
We prove it below, factoring-in as previously the remarks about \prc|x$_i$| possibly being an array and having to \enquote{chase down} the exact pair of variables violating anytime non-interference.

%By \autoref{lem:sfma},
\autoref{eq:proof-assumption} implies that there is a sub-program \(\prc|C|'\) of \prc|C| such that \(\prc|x$_j$| \in \In(\prc|C|')\) and \(\prc|x$_i$| \in \Out(\prc|C|')\)\footnote{%
Remembering \autoref{table:def-out-in-occ}, if \prc|x$_j$| occurs in the expression of a condition, it occurs in the \(\In\) set of the overall program.}. By a reasoning similar to the previous case, it means that \(\prc|C|'\) has one of the three forms (A), (L) or (B) presented in Listings~\ref{listing-A}--\ref{listing-I}.

Now, consider two values lists \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\) that are up-to \(\ell(\prc|x$_i$|)\) equivalent, and assume by contradiction that \autoref{eq:proof-goal} does not hold.
It means that \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\) can diverge on the value of \(v_j\) that gets attributed to \prc|x$_j$|, but that at any time counter \(t\), we should have \(\prc|C|'[\vec{v} \rightarrow \vec{v'}]_t, \prc|C|'[\vec{w} \rightarrow \vec{w'}]_t \implies \vec{v'}\upce{\scl{c}} \vec{w'}\).
However, depending on the form of \(\prc|C|'\), the value held by \prc|x$_j$| will impact directly (A) or indirectly ((L), (B)) the value held by \prc|x$_i$| at a particular time, or the number of time it is updated\footnote{This is where our \enquote{falsifiability of expressions} hypothesis is used.}, contradicting anytime non-interference of $\prc|C|'$ and hence of $\prc|C|$.\qedhere
\end{description}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Appendix B: Examples}\label{sec:examples}

To ease the presentation, we present the construction equations as inference rules, treating the inductive ones as inference rules with hypothesis, and the base cases (assignment, \prc|skip|, but also computing the correction) as axioms.

\begin{example}[Transitive information flow]
Consider a program of two commands:

\begin{lstlisting}
if (h==0) then y = 1 else skip  // C1
if (y==0) then z = 1 else y = z   // C2
\end{lstlisting}
Although no direct assignment exists from \prc|h| to \prc|z|, the variables are transitively dependent through \prc|y|.
The matrix labels are \prc|h y z| but omitted for compactness.
The derivation is
\begin{center}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
\begin{prooftree}[small]
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|y==1|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[skip]{\prc|Skip|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[Cr]{\prc|h==0|:  \mat{\nv & \vi & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer3[Cond]{\prc|C1|:  \mat{\nv & \vi & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|z==1|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|y=z|: \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \vi & \nv}}
\infer0[Cr]{\prc|y==0|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \vi \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer3[Cond]{\prc|C2|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \vi \\ \nv & \vi & \nv}}
\infer2[Comp]{\prc|C1;C2|: \mat{\nv & \vi & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \vi \\ \nv & \vi & \nv}}
\end{prooftree}
}\end{center}

The concluding matrix captures the flows: \prc|z| to \prc|y|, \prc|h| to \prc|y| and \prc|y| to \prc|z|,
but does not show (at top-right) the transitive flow from \prc|h| to \prc|z|.
A violation depends on the assignment of security classes.
Non-interference requires \(\lvl{\prc|h|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|y|}\) and \(\lvl{\prc|y|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|z|}\).
This exposes the transitive flow $\lvl{\prc|h|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|z|}$.
A \SFM contains more information than what is immediately visible.
\qed\end{example}

\begin{example}[Composition irrelevance]\label{ex:composition-order}
We derive a matrix for program %\prc|z = 3; x = y; x = z| by
\begin{lstlisting}
z = 3; x = y; x = z
\end{lstlisting}
by

\begin{center}\scalebox{1}{
\begin{prooftree}[small]
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|z=3|:          \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|x=y|:          \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \vi & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer2[Comp]{\prc|z=3;x=y|:      \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \vi & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv}}
\infer0[Asgn]{\prc|x=z|:          \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \nv & \nv & \nv \\ \vi & \nv & \nv}}
\infer2[Comp]{\prc|z=3;x=y;x=z|:  \mat{\nv & \nv & \nv \\ \vi & \nv & \nv \\ \vi & \nv & \nv}}
\end{prooftree}
}\end{center}
%
%\clem{Another interesting example is \prc|x=y; x=3|, because even though the violation may seem "forgotten" by the fact that \prc|x| gets re-initialized, the \(\vi\) coef. actually \enquote{survives} and still tag this flow as insecure.}
%\noindent
The matrix labels are \prc|x y z|.
If \prc|y| holds secret data, and \prc|x| is a public with \(\lvl{\prc|x|} < \lvl{\prc|y|}\), the program violates
anytime non-interference.
Although \prc|x| is overwritten in a later command, a violation cannot be erased once it has occurred.
%In other words, statements that precede or follow an insecure operation do not cancel the interference triggered by the operation.
Also observe that composition is commutative -- composing the commands in any order would yield the same program matrix.
\qed
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Context sensitivity]\label{ex:sql}
The following program (from~\cite{huang2014} adjusted to \autoref{fig:grammar})
shows assignments to string buffers \prc|sb1| and \prc|sb2|.
The potentially sensitive \prc|request| does not interfere with \prc|query|.
A context-sensitive analysis detects this and does not raise an unnecessary alarm.

\noindent\begin{minipage}{.65\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
user = request["user"];
sb1 = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name=";
sb2 = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name=";
sb1 += user;
sb2 += "John";
query=sb2;
// execute query
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill\scalebox{.95}{
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]

\prc|sb1|    & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|sb2|    & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi  \\
\prc|query|  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\end{pNiceMatrix}$}

The program matrix is on the right.
An anytime non-interference violation is avoided if
\(\lvl{\prc|request|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|user|}\),
\(\lvl{\prc|user|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|sb1|}\), and
\(\lvl{\prc|sb2|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|query|}\).
Since \prc|request| and \prc|query| are disjoint in the matrix, the variables are anytime non-interfering for all security classes.
\qed
\end{example}

Our next analysis example requires a policy with incomparable security classes, like the one we present now.

\begin{example}[HMO information flow policy]\label{ex-hasse-diagram-HMO}
The \(\HMO\) (for Health Maintenance Organization) information flow policy, represented as a Hasse diagram, is:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.8\textwidth}
{\centering

\tikz[node distance=1.5cm]{
\node (p) {public};
\node (r) [above left of=p] {research};
\node (f) [above right of=p] {funding};
\node (o) [above right of=r] {organization};
\draw[->] (p) -- (r);
\draw[->] (p) -- (f);
\draw[->] (f) -- (o);
\draw[->] (r) -- (o);
}

}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
%	for \emph{public}, \emph{research}, and \emph{funding} information using a more advanced policy:
%	\(\HMO=(\{\scl{p}, \scl{r}, \scl{f}, \scl{h}\}, \{\scl{p} \leqslant \scl{r}, \scl{p} \leqslant \scl{f}, \scl{r} \leqslant \scl{h}, \scl{f} \leqslant \scl{h}\})\),
%	where research and funding information access is disjoint,
%	except for the top-level security class \emph{h}, that is allowed access to all information.
%\noindent
%We sometimes abbreviate each class by its first three letters.

\begin{example}[Incomparable security classes]
The mvt--kernel, from the {PolyBench/C}~\cite{polybenchc}
parallel programming benchmark suite, calculates a \textbf{m}atrix \textbf{v}ector product and \textbf{t}ranspose.

\noindent\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.65\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
void kernel_mvt(|$\dots$|){
for (i=0; i<N; i++)
for (j=0; j<N; j++)
x1[i] = x1[i]+A[i][j]*y1[j];
for (i=0; i<N; i++)
for (j=0; j<N; j++)
x2[i] = x2[i]+A[j][i]*y2[j];
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\scalebox{.85}{$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|i|  & \prc|j| & \prc|N| & \prc|x1| & \prc|x2| & \prc|y1| & \prc|y2| & \prc|A| \\
\prc|i|   & \nv & \vi & \nv & \vi & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|j|   & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|N|   & \vi & \vi & \nv & \vi & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|x1|  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|x2|  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|y1|  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|y2|  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\prc|A|   & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv  \\
\end{pNiceMatrix}$}\end{center}
Observe that \prc|x1| and \prc|x2| are disjoint, sharing no observable information flow in the matrix.
Their security classes may be incomparable.
Using the HMO policy, the assignment
\begin{align*}
\{\prc|i|, \prc|j|, \prc|N|, \prc|A|\} &\mapsto \text{public} &&&
\{\prc|y1|, \prc|x1|\} & \mapsto \text{research} &&&
\{\prc|y2|, \prc|x2|\} & \mapsto \text{funding}
\end{align*}
is satisfactory.
Similarly, assignment \(\lvl{\prc|x1|} = \text{organization}\) satisfies anytime non-interference.
However, \(\lvl{\prc|A|} = \text{research}\) is a violation because
we have $\sfm{\prc|C|}(\prc|A|,\prc|x2|)=\vi$.
It would require that research $\leqslant$ funding, but by the HMO policy the classes are incomparable.

\begin{example}[Function calls and arrays]%
\label{ex:fct}
%\clem{Should be moved to the right section?} maybe no space;
%Refer to it here if it is needed to illustrate a point somewhere elsewhere?
The program references two functions (treated as pure), called inside the condition and inside the body of a \prc|while| loop:

\noindent\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{.3\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}
while(y < f(b)){
t[f(b)] = x;
a = t[a] + b;
y = g(b, x);
x = f(a);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hspace{2em}
\begin{minipage}{.5\linewidth}
%\scalebox{.85}{
$\begin{pNiceMatrix}[first-row,first-col]
& \prc|t| & \prc|a|  & \prc|b| & \prc|x| & \prc|y| & \prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\mathtt{a}}$| & \prc|f$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\mathtt{b}}$| & \prc|g$^{\mathtt{out}}_{\mathtt{b},\mathtt{x}}$| \\
\prc|t| & \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv \\
\prc|a| & \nv  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv \\
\prc|b| & \nv  & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv \\
\prc|x| & \vi  & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv \\

\prc|f$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{b}}$| & \vi & \vi & \nv & \vi & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv\\
\prc|g$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{b},\mathtt{x}}$| & \nv & \nv & \nv & \nv & \vi & \nv & \nv & \nv

%The logic assigns the program the a matrix on right. % \clem{Check me if you can!} -- it is correct.
Since variables introduced for (pure) function calls correspond to \emph{expressions}, they do not belong to any \(\Out\) set,
and their columns in a security flow matrix will always be empty.
However, the class of function parameters can be considered with additional constraints, not reported in the security-flow matrix.
Typically, one can require that \(\lvl{\prc|g$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{b}, \mathtt{x}}$|} = \max(\lvl{\prc|b|}, \lvl{\prc|x|})\) for all pairs \prc|x|, \prc|b| such that \prc|g(b, x)| occurs in the program.
This would invalidate a level assignment with \eg \(\lvl{\prc|t|} < \lvl{\prc|b|}\), since \(\lvl{\prc|b|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|g$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{b}, \mathtt{x}}$|}\) would be required by this condition, and \(\lvl{\prc|g$^{\mathtt{in}}_{\mathtt{b}, \mathtt{x}}$|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|y|} \leqslant \lvl{\prc|t|}\) are required by the security-flow matrix.
