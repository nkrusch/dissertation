Implicit Computational Complexity (ICC)~\cite{dallago2011}

\begin{quote}
Let \(L\) be a programming language, \(C\) a complexity class, and \(\sem{p}\) the function computed by program \(p\).
Then the task is to find a restriction \(R \subseteq L\), such that the following equality holds:
\begin{align*}
\{ \sem{p} \mid p \in R \} = C.
\end{align*}
The variables \(L\), \(C\), and \(R\) are the parameters that vary greatly between different ICC systems.
