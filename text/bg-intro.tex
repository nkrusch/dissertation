%Literature review and discussion of the rationale of the project.
%It is expected that the literature review will be more comprehensive than those presented in the included publications.

This section is organized thematically.
It provides additional context for the manuscripts in this dissertation.

The subsections are self-contained introductions to a topic.
Beyond basic computer science, the topics do not assume expertise and can be accessed in any order.
Therefore, rather than reading linearly, an advisable strategy is to return to this section iff a manuscript creates the need to understand more broadly the {bigger picture}.

Refer to~\autoref{tab:paper-bg} for guidance on how the dissertation manuscripts connect to this section.
