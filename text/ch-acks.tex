Multiple individuals deserve repeated recognitions for their impact in my doctoral journey.
However, in interest of brevity, I have adopted a principle from \emph{linear types}: mentioning each name exactly once.\footnote{Except Clément, because his influence requires multiple mentions.}
Let that principle not diminish the significance of anyone's role. % in this achievement.

\paragraph*{Family.}
I appreciate my parents, Eila and Leif, for the foundations they instilled in me many years ago.
I am thankful to my children, Ileana and Tommy, for their roles in my studies.
I am incredibly proud of you.
Tank, my fondest companion, was with me every year I spent at Augusta University, 2011--2025, and is now with me forever.

\paragraph*{Academic thanks.}
My history at {Augusta University} is extensive.
It involves three institutional names\footnote{Augusta State University, Georgia Regents University, and Augusta University.},
various roles, learning moments, and interactions with many exceptional individuals.
My current achievements are thanks to the last one.
In these acknowledgements, I aim to capture everyone who contributed overall positively to this outcome (though, I still end with a sound under-approximation).

From my undergraduate years, 2011--2014, I appreciate every professor who was teaching computer science at the time: Joanne Sexton, Mike Dowell, Onyeka Ezenwoye, and Paul York.
From them, I learned the foundations of my discipline.
My undergraduate experience was encouraging, nurturing, and provided the skills that helped me succeed later, at Georgia Institute of Technology and various companies.
I am thankful to Joseph Hauger and Sam Robinson (Professor Emeritus), from the College of Science and Mathematics, for supporting me financially during those years through the Savannah River Scholar's Program.
I am also thankful for the instruction of Predrag Punoševac as I understood the value of his teachings only years later.
Finally, I appreciate Jurgen Brauer (Professor Emeritus), Walter Evans (Professor Emeritus), and Jeonghyeon (Justin) Choi, of the Medical College of Georgia;
for creating me opportunities in software engineering before I even graduated.

After an enriching hiatus, I returned to Augusta University in 2019.
First as an instructor and soon as a doctoral student.\footnote{In 2020 or 2021, depending on where we set the official start.}
This return was prompted in response to the many invitations and encouragement I received (again) from my undergraduate professors.
I recognize and thank Steve Weldon for his role in supporting this transition.
I appreciate my fellow pioneering students, James O'Meara and William Cocke, who were present with me in those early days of the computer science doctoral program, in the spring of 2021.

The years of my doctoral study were made pleasant and memorable thanks to the many friends and colleagues I met at the \emph{Palazzo}\footnote{The name was inspired by Konstantin Britikov and Rodrigo Otoni, and validated by Simone Gazza.} in Summerville.
I thank Deivid Vale, Gabriele Cecilia, Jason Weeks, Mahady Hassan, Mark Holcomb, Peter Hanukaev, and Vignesh Sivakumar, for sharing the experienced of the programming languages reading group and $\Delta\Lambda\Delta$, and for the many office events, and other magical moments.
A special recognition to my fellow Palazzo ladies and friends, Nour Alhussien and Zain Haloush.
I am excited for all our futures and for learning what happens in the next chapters.

Being in the first cohort in a doctoral program was minimally a character-building experience.
It required much resilience and tenacity, since various policies were not in place, or were not yet fitted for computer science.
I accumulated many \enquote{firsts} and uncovered several edge cases.
As I approach the end, I find much joy in that the situation is now more stable (though, many improvements are still necessary).

During these turbulent times, I greatly appreciate the stability, peace, and support I found at The Graduate School (TGS).
I particularly recognize the leadership, commitment, and consistency in action of the TGS Dean, Jennifer Sullivan.
I also appreciate Patricia Cameron for her responsiveness and support, especially during the Three Minute Thesis competition, and
Emily Crider, for prompt responses and support of the graduate students.

Across other departments, I am thankful for the supportive and positive staff at the Center of Writing Excellence---%
Brilynn Janckila%
, Candis Bond%
, Hannah Soblo%
, Makayla Mathews%
, and Romana Hinton---%
for I was a regular at the center during my doctoral years.

Easily the most influential person in my doctoral study was my advisor and scientific mentor, Clément Aubert.
I started my doctoral study without research experience, but  through his guidance, developed an appreciation for the elegance and beauty of theoretical computer science.
Through years of mentoring and countless conversations, he helped me grow as a person and instilled the research skills that will carry me in the future.
I saddens me greatly that our interactions are inevitably ending, and that I am completely incapable of expressing adequately my gratitude for the past.
The Augusta University community is infinitely enriched by your presence and mentorship;
hopefully, many more students get to experience it.

Relating to research, I am thankful for my collaborators, Thomas Rubiano and Thomas Seiller, for the many projects we completed together.
In my mind, our projects represent the ideal model of scientific collaboration, and I am happy to have experienced that model early.
I am also thankful to the members of my doctoral committee.
Bogdan Chlebus, for his impact in those early days of the doctoral program, and for the guidance that led me to the best advisor.
Harley Eades III, for instituting programming languages research in Augusta and for introducing me to functional reactive programming.
Martin Avanzini, for graciously hosting me in Sofia Antipolis, and for the many fascinating conversations about the flow calculus.
Yuyan Bao, for the many thoughtful conversations, reading group experiences, and our shared experiences in Denver.

Outside Augusta, my doctoral journey was greatly elevated by the fascinating people I met on my many travels.
Besides the names already mentioned, I appreciate the following individuals---%
for the conversations, guidance, inspiration, memories, shared adventures, and friendship---%
that enhanced and shaped my doctoral experience.

\paragraph*{Technical recognitions.}
This dissertation benefits from many open source software, developed benevolently by contributors around the world.
I thank the development teams of the many excellent scientific programming tools---like the Rocq Prover, Dafny, and Python---that regularly support my research.

On a more individual level,
I thank Clément Aubert for the initiative and action of preparing the open source \href{https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/au_ccs_dissertation_template}{LaTeX
template for doctoral dissertations}, that is now available for all students of the Graduate School at Augusta University.

I appreciate Saverio Giallorenzo, Fabrizio Montesi, and Marco Peressotti, for their artistry in styling code blocks in~\cite{giallorenzo2024},
and for sharing those sources on arXiv.
The same style is used throughout this dissertation.

Finally, I was greatly impressed by the work of Swaraj Dash, Younesse Kaddar, Hugo Paquet, and Sam Staton in~\cite{dash2023};
