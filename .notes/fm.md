# The Coq proof assistant

Introduce it.
Why is it good for formalizing things.
Include some previous successes.
Software foundations series~\cite{softwarefoundation1, softwarefoundation2}.
The coq community boards (Coq-Club mailing list~\cite{coqclub}),
Show a simple proof.

# Mathematical Components

The mathematical components (Mathcomp) library extends the Coq
ecosystem by formalizing foundational notions of mathematics. It
contains various topics, from basic data structures to different flavors
of algebra, organized internally into hierarchical levels .

# Formal Methods

Formal Verification Techniques, https://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT23/
Could include some nice categorization of techniques.
Interactive Theorem Provers: Coq Agda Lean Isabelle.
This is different from automatic theorem provers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant#Formalization_extent:

> Formalization extent:
    Freek Wiedijk has been keeping a ranking of proof
    assistants by the amount of formalized theorems out of a list of 100 well-known theorems.
    As of September 2023, only five systems have formalized proofs of more
    than 70\% of the theorems: Isabelle, HOL Light, Coq, Lean and Metamath
