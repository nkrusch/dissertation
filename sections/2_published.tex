\subsection{pymwp: A Static Analyzer Determining Polynomial Growth Bounds}
\label{subsec:pymwp}

pymwp is a static program analyzer that determines if variables of an input program have polynomial growth bounds.
The following publication explains precisely, what is a \enquote{growth bound}, how the analyzer operates, and demonstrates experimentally its performance.
This work was published in October 2023, in the proceedings of the 21st International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis\footnote{ATVA \href{https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/1357/}{CORE ranking is B}, and in 2023 the acceptance rate was 32\% (37/115 submissions).}, ATVA 2023.
