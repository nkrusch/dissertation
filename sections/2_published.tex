\subsection{pymwp: A Static Analyzer Determining Polynomial Growth Bounds}
\label{subsec:pymwp}

pymwp is a static program analyzer that determines if variables of an input program have polynomial growth bounds.
The following publication explains what precisely is a \enquote{growth bound}, how the analyzer operates, and demonstrates experimentally its performance.
The theoretical foundations of pymwp are detailed in a prior publication, in \autoref{subsec:fscd_2022}.
This work was published in October 2023, in the proceedings of the 21st International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification and Analysis\footnote{ATVA \href{https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/1357/}{CORE ranking is B}, and in 2023 the acceptance rate was 32\% (37/115 submissions).}, ATVA 2023.
This publication is accompanied by a tool user guide, included in \autoref{subsec:pymwp-tool-user-guide}.
The pymwp version corresponding to this publication is preserved in an archival repository on Zenodo, \href{https://zenodo.org/records/7908484}{DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7908484}.
