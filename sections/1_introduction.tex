As famously stated by Dijkstra: “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.”

Static program analysis aims to automatically answer questions about the possible behaviors of programs.
Foundational approaches include: basic type analysis, lattice theory, control flow graphs, dataflow analysis, fixed-point algorithms, widening and narrowing, path sensitivity, relational analysis, interprocedural analysis, context sensitivity, control flow analysis, several flavors of pointer analysis, and abstract interpretation.
