Could include some nice categorization of techniques.

\subsubsection{Interactive Theorem Provers}

Coq Agda Lean Isabelle.
This is different from automatic theorem provers.

Formalization extent:
Freek Wiedijk has been keeping a ranking of proof
assistants by the amount of formalized theorems out of a list of 100 well-known theorems.
As of September 2023, only five systems have formalized proofs of more
than 70\% of the theorems: Isabelle, HOL Light, Coq, Lean and
Metamath~\cite{proofassistants}.
