\subsection{The Coq Proof Assistant}
\label{subsec:coq}

The Coq proof assistant~\cite{coq}, \dots, introduce it.

Why is it good for formalizing things.
Include some previous successes.

Software foundations series~\cite{softwarefoundation1, softwarefoundation2}.

The coq community boards (Coq-Club mailing list~\cite{coqclub}),

relevant conferences~\cite{itp, cpp}.

Show a simple proof.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Components}

The mathematical components (\enquote{Mathcomp}) library~\cite{mahboubi2022} extends the Coq ecosystem by formalizing foundational notions of mathematics.
It contains various topics, from basic data structures to different flavors of algebra, organized internally into hierarchical levels
