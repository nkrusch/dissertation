\subsection{Implicit Computational Complexity}\label{subsec:icc}

\textit{Implicit computational complexity} (ICC) seeks to find
characterizations of complexity classes in machine-independent ways.
Detailed introductions to ICC can be found in literature
~\cite{dallago2012,moyen2017,pechoux2020,dallago2022}.
A general description of ICC, by

\begin{quote}
Let $L$ be a programming language, $C$ a complexity class, and $[\![ p ]\!]$ the function computed by program $p$.
Then the task is to find a restriction $R \subseteq L$, such that the following equality holds: $\{ [\![ p ]\!] \; \vert \; p \in R \} = C$.
The variables $L$, $C$, and $R$ are the parameters that vary greatly between different ICC systems. \hfill (R. )
