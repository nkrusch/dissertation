\subsection{Implicit Computational Complexity}\label{subsec:icc}

Detailed introductions to ICC can be found in literature
~\cite{dallago2012,moyen2017,pechoux2020,dallago2022}.

A general description of ICC has been given~\cite{pechoux2020} as follows: let $L$ be a programming language, $C$ a complexity class, and $[\![ p ]\!]$ the function computed by program $p$.
Then the task is to find a restriction $R \subseteq L$, such that the following equality holds: $\{ [\![ p ]\!] \; \vert \; p \in R \} = C$.
The variables $L$, $C$, and $R$ are the parameters that vary greatly between different ICC systems.
