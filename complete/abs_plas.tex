Sensitive data exposure is persistently ranked among the top-ten web application security risks, thus every software developer should actively combat data exposure vulnerabilities.
Information flow controls offer mechanisms to enforce data confidentiality.
Unfortunately, strict controls are too restrictive for real applications and innovation is needed to obtain practical solutions.
We present a brave new idea: an information flow calculus for non-interference.
Our formulation enforces that command composition does not create nor erase non-interference violations, and the sound calculus pinpoints precisely where violations occur.
The calculus can be implemented as an automatic, compositional, and annotation-free static security analyzer to obtain confidentiality guarantees in practice.
