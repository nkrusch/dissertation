The Ideal of Verified Software

In the current state of the art, I regard our challenge as a scientific
one, like the challenge of the human genome. Engineering challenges are
also very important, but they differ from scientific challenges in their
goals, their scope, their timescales and other constraints. A typical
engineering challenge is Please find the bugs in this particular program
before its delivery date (say next Tuesday). Scientists often engage
themselves in such short-term challenges, and find it rewarding to earn
the gratitude of their clients and customers. But Science itself is
something different. It is motivated primarily by curiosity: it seeks
the answers to basic questions, and aims at ideals that no engineer can
afford to pursue. A typical scientific challenge seeks answers to
questions How and why does software work. And how can we exploit this
knowledge to make programs that are correct? And it is this kind of
challenge that I would like to focus on.
